            I grew up in a Filipino household in San Diego my whole life. I've lived
            in National City for as long as I can remember. I went to Bethune K-8 from
            kindergarten to 8th grade. Then, I graduated Morse High School.

            Currently, I am now attending Southwestern College to gain experience and
            obtain a degree or some certificates for Web Design & Development. I was a
            Computer Science Major, but I've recently switched because of my dislike
            for math. I've also thought that Web Design felt more for me.

            My plan is to build a great E-portfolio with an extensive showcase of
            amazing websites and projects as well as to get my associate's degree in
            Web Design & Development. I am currently working on that E-portfolio right
            now and am trying to strengthen my coding skills. Ideally, I would like to
            get a job as soon as possible, but if not, I plan on continuing school and
            getting a bachelor's degree to help me in my applications.
